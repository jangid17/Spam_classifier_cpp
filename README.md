Spam Email Classifier with GUI using Hash Maps

# 📧 Spam Email Classifier (C++ + GTK GUI)

This project implements a **spam email classifier** using **hash maps** (chaining and open addressing) and a **GTK-based GUI** in C++. It classifies emails based on word frequencies learned from a dataset (CSV) and provides both classification and interactive visualizations.
